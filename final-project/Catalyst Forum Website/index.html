		<h3 class="cforum_overview_header">Are you an independent school leader faced with the challenges of responding to recent facility, economic, and demographic shifts?</h1>
		<p>Since the economic downturn there have been a variety of factors that have shifted the characteristics of American households. Maintaining and increasing enrollment amidst these rapid changes is often requiring school leaders to make changes to the enrollment strategy and compels a comprehensive analysis of how both the delivery of education and the physical assets of the campus drive targeted outcomes that align with these new strategic objectives.</p>
		<p>Join us in this collaborate workshop to discuss ideas on how to build a forward-thinking and mission-driven strategy through renewed educational delivery and capital campaigns.</p>
